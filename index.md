## Why?

My primary goal is to empower people, especially underprivileged people, by teaching them how to write code.  I want everyone to know that they can learn how to program. I want everyone to get the support that they need regardless of economic or social status.  I believe that everyone can be a coder, it just takes time & consistent practice.

## Class Structure

These are self-paced lessons where each lesson builds on the last.  I know people learn at different rates, and I never want anyone to feel rushed.  The goal is for students to become an excellent programmers, so it's essential that everyone understands every concept before moving to the next.  If you find yourself going fast, help someone in class out.  

## About Instructor

I am Noah Glaser and I have been teach community programing classes for the past 3 years.  My background is in web development.  I specialize in PHP and javascript, but also passionate about Arduino and Android programming.  I teach both adult and youth classes.

## What you'll learn

Students will learn how to build apps that control the Arduino (Small computer used to build robots, 3d printers, and various hardware systems.)  Students learn how to program with Bluetooth, led light strips, small motors, and more.  In this course students will learn the basics of behind writing code and they will leaving having built various Arduino and Android Apps.  The program is taught with Google's Blockly language, which is a language designed to teach new coders.   Open to all kinds of workshops, so please [contact me](/contact) with  ideas.
