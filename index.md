## Why?

Because it's fun!!! I feel that everyone can have fun and should have fun learning and building awesome projects, regardless of who they are or where they come from.  I want you to know this is not above you, and that you can do this! :)

## Class Structure

All classes are hands on and are project based, meaning there is a completed project at the end of the class. There is no grade, and thus there are no stupid questions.  Welcome to a class without pressure or expectations.  All you have to do is show up!!! :)

## About Instructor

My name is Noah Glaser, by day I am a web developer, by night / weekend I am volunteer educator.  I've been teaching for free for over 4 years and loving it.  Right now I mostly focus on Arduino but I am expanding into game development and possibly web dev as well.  I also love to juggle, and  tell bad dad jokes.

## What you can expect?

I assume that you are starting from scratch.  So you can expect that we'll be going over everything from the ground up.  Most classes are project based meaning you learn by building.  I don't think I'll ever teaching anything that is not hands on. 

A lot of our classes use blockly, a free drag and drop language developed by google.  This a great way for people just starting, because it allows them to focus on the concepts and not the weird symbols in programming.  

All our classes are mixed, meaning usually people between the ages of 6 to 80 show up.  **Everyone** is welcome!!! The classes are free, you can see a complete list [here](/class-schedule).


## Location

Classes right now are held at the oakland library main branch. They are held Thursday from 5:45 to 7:45.  Please check the [Class schedule](/class-schedule) for exceptions.
