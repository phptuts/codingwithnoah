## Why?

My primary goal is to empower people, especially underprivileged people, by teaching them how to write code.  I want everyone to know that they can learn how to program. I want everyone to get the support that they need regardless of economic or social status.  I believe that everyone can be a coder, it just takes time & consistent practice.

## Class Structure

These are self-paced lessons where each lesson builds on the other one.  I know people learn at different rates and I never want anyone to feel rushed.  I want you to become an excellent programmer, so it's essential that you understand every concept.  If you find yourself going fast, help someone in class out.  
## Location

For now classes are held [Omni Commons](https://omnicommons.org/).  If you have any questions or comments email me at glaserpower [at] gmail.com.  I would like to see them put into libraries long term.
