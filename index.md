excerpt: "Empowering people by teaching them to code."

## Why?

My main goal is to empower people, especially underprivileged people, by teaching them how to write code.  I want everyone to know that they can learn how to program. I want everyone to get the support that they need regardless of economic or social status.  I believe that everyone can be a coder, it just takes time & consistent practice.

## Class Structure

I will have a 3 to 5 minute presentation on the class and what it is about. This will include a demo and some basic theory.  The rest of the class is hands on. You will be able to go at your own pace. The only thing I ask is if you do speed through the class, that you help out your fellow students out.  Each class will also have challenges as well.  You can find a complete class schedule [here](/class-schedule/), and for list of classes go [here](/lessons/).

## Location

All classes will be held at the [Omni Commons](https://omnicommons.org/) pending approval. If you have any questions or comments email me at glaserpower [at] gmail.com.
