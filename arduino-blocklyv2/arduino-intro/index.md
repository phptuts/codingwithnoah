    - name: What's an Arduino?
      steps:
        - type: video

          text: An Arduino is a cheap real time computer that costs around 7 dollars. Real time means that will execute your code really fast.  It can do this because there is no operating system running on the Arduino.  The only thing it's doing is running your code. :)
        - type: image
          src: '/images/arduino-blocklyv2/arduino-intro/arduino-pins.jpg'
          text: Pins are the pieces of metal that stick out of the Arduino.  They are covered with plastic.

          text: Where is the Arduino's brain?
        - type: image
          src: '/images/arduino-blocklyv2/arduino-intro/arduino-rx-tx.jpg'
          text: TX Stands for Transmit, this pin is used to send messages to another computer.  RX stands for Receive, this pin is used to receive messages from another computer.  When the Arduino receives or sends a message to a computer RX or TX leds light up.
        - type: image

          text: The reset is the restart button on the Arduino.
    - name: 'Input & Output'
      steps:
        - type: image
          src: '/images/arduino-blocklyv2/arduino-intro/motion_sensor.jpg'
          text: Input means that pin or piece of metal attached to the Arduino sensing whether electricity is passing through it.  This is often used with sensor to tell the Arduino that something has changed.  An example would be a motion sensor,  
        - type: image
          src: '/images/arduino-blocklyv2/arduino-intro/leds.jpg'
          text: Output means the arduino is sending electricity through the pin or piece of metal attached to the Arduino.  This is often used to control motors, leds, and other electronic devices.
    - name: 'Challenge 1'
      steps:
        - type: image
          src: '/images/arduino-blocklyv2/arduino-intro/challenge-1.jpg'
          text: Which electronic item is using input and which one using output?  Put your answers and the reason why in the text are to the right of the screen.
