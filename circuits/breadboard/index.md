## Completed Project

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x poster board ($1.00)
- 16 x wires ($.5)
- 1 x wire stripper ($12.00)
- 1 x 3 volt watch battery ($4.00)
- 1 x led ($.04)
- 1 x resistor ($.04)
- 1 x ruler ($1.00)
- tape ($.01)
- total $18.59

## New Electrical Components 

The breadboard is used to create / prototype electronic projects without gluing the wires together with metal.

## Instructions

Group into groups of 4 to 5 people.  

1) Draw 2 horizontal lines at the bottom of the poser board.  The lines should be about 2 feet in length.

![step 1](/images/circuits/breadboard/step_1.jpg)

2) Draw a big dot every 6 inches on each of the lines.

3) Draw 3 vertical lines each about 1 foot a part and a foot in length.

4) Draw a dot on each line every 6 inches.

5) Use the wire strippers to cut 16 wires 7 inches long.  Strip 6 inches on each end of the wire.

6) Attach the wires one the horizontal lines you have draw.  Draw a + on top and a - on the bottom of the poster board.  Then call an instructor to review your work.

7) Do the same thing you did in the previous step to the columns above.

8) Attach the battery to the bottom wires.  Do this by placing the (-) wire on the bottom and the (+) wire on the top.  Then tape it all down.  Then call an instructor to review your work.

9) Attach a wire from the positive row to the first column.

10) Attach a wire from the negative row  to the second column.

![step 10](/images/circuits/breadboard/step_10.jpg)

11) Attach the positive end of the led to the first column and the negative end of the led to the second column.  The led positive end will be marked with a piece of tape.

### Challenge 1) 

Can rewire the circuit to use an led?

### Challenge 2) 

Can you recreate what you did with on an actual breadboard?

Hint: to do this you will have to remove the watch battery and cut new wire.

## Review

- What is a breadboard?
- How which holes are connected to each other?
- Why would you want to use a breadboard?
- What did you learn?
