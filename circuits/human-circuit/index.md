## Objective

To learn about how electricity works with batteries, led, and resistors.

## Kit

![Project Kit](/images/circuits/human-circuit/project.jpg)

## Completed Project

![Human Circuit](/images/circuits/human-circuit/what-it-looks-like.jpg)

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x Watch Battery 3 volts ($5.00)
- Wires ($.50)
- 1 x Resistor under 1000 ohms ($.04)
- 1 x led ($.09)
- total $5.93 

## New Electrical Components 

### Led

The led stands for light emitting diode.  The important thing to note are the wires connected to it.  The long wire is  positive and the short wire is negative.  When you pass electricity through it, it will emit light.

### Resistor

The resistor is used to decrease the amount of electrons flowing through the wire.  The strength of the resistor is marked by the colored bands.  You can use the [calculator](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/resistor-color-code-calculator/) to learn more.

### Battery

The battery is power source of a circuit.  All batteries have a positive side and a negative side.  Electricity will flow from the positive side to the negative side (ground).  The reason we diagram things out this way is because the standard was set in the 1800's and we would have to change everything in order to fix it.

## Instructions

1) Get in a circle and connect all the wires together with the led and the battery.  The instructor will hold the battery.

2) Notice the light went on when the instructor touches the battery to the wires.  

3) Now ask the students what will happen once a person disconnects their wire?  

4) Then have a person do this to see who was right.

5) Pass the battery around the circle and ask the students if they can tell you which side is positive and which side is negative.

6) The instructor takes back the battery back.  Then ask what will happen to the led if we switch the way the battery is hooked into the circuit.

7) Then do it and see what happens.

An led will only let electricity flow one way from the positive end to the negative end.   LED stand for light emitting diode.  A diode is an electronic component that only allow electricity to flow one way.  Electricity flows from positive to ground.  The reason that we view it this way is because people in the 1800's got it wrong. :)

9) Now have the other instructor place a resistor into the circuit.  

10) Now ask the students what will happen if the instructor switches the side the resistor is hooked up. 

11) Now have the instructor do that.

12) Now have students blink the led 1 second for 20 seconds.  

## Review

- Can you did better than a computer could, and not why?
- What is a resistor?
- What is an led?
- What is a battery?
- Which direction does electricity flow from in the diagrams?
- What did you learn?
