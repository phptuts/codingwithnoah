## Objective

To be able to use ohms law to calculate the resistor required to safely complete the circuit

## Kit

## Complete Project

## Bill of Material

## Volts

You can look at volts like water pressure.  It's a measurement of force that drives the electrons from the positive end of the power source / battery to ground.



## Resistance

A measurement of a materials ability to resist the flow of electrons.  The more a material is able to resist the flow electrons the higher it's resistance.  Resistance in a circuit is measured in ohms.  This is why resistor value is in ohms.  



## Amps

Is a measurement of the number of electrons going through a circuit.  One amp means that 6,241,509,629,152,650,000 electrons are going through the wire every second.  


## Ohm's Law

### V = I x R
