## Complete Project

## Bill of Material

- 1 x 9 volt battery
- 1 x 1000 ohm resistor
- 1 x 1 led

## Volts

You can look at volts like water pressure.  It's a measurement of force that drives the electrons from the positive end of the (power source / battery) to ground.

## Resistance

A measurement of a materials ability to resist the flow of electrons.  The more a material is able to resist the flow electrons the higher it's resistance.  Resistance in a circuit is measured in ohms. You can think about increasing the resistance by pressing on a straw, while drinking.  You decrease the amount of water flowing through the straw but you increase the (pressure / force aka volts).


#### Low Resistance Example.  

Notice how there is less for force from the pipe.

#### High Resistance Example

Notice that when we increase the amount of water that can go through the pipe that the water pressure increases.

## Amps

Is a measurement of the number of electrons going through a circuit.  One amp means that 6,241,509,629,152,650,000 electrons are going through the wire every second.  So if you increase the amount of electrons going through the circuit you increase it's the pressure / force of the electrons in the circuit.

## Ohm's Law

### V = I x R

The big thing to note is the relationship between volts and resistance and amps.  If you increase amps and the resistance stays the same, the volts will go up.  This like saying if the pipe size stays the same but the amount of (water/electrons) going through the (pipe/wire) increase, the (water pressure/volts) will go up.  Same thing holds true for resistance.  If the amount of (water/electrons) going through remains the same, but the size of the pipe decrease / resistance increasing, then the (water pressure/volts) will go up.

### An example

Say you have a 5 volt battery and you have an led that requires (.02 amps/20 milliamps) of current.  What is the resistor required to complete the circuit.  The easy way to figure this out is to use the ohms law triangle.  Simply cover up what you are trying to solve for.  In our case we would cover up "R" for resistance.

![ohms law triangle](/images/circuits/ohms-law/ohms-triangle-covered.jpeg#img-phone)

Based on the triangle we can say that we need to divide 5 volts by the .02 amps.  This means that we would need a 250 ohms resistor in order to use the led.


## Instructions

1) Take the positive end of an led touch that to a 9 volt battery, while touching the short end of the led to negative end of the battery. Notice that after a few seconds or so the led burns out.

2) Take the 9 volt battery connector and attach it to the 9 volt battery.

3) Connect the red wire to the + side of the breadboard and the black wire to the - side of the breadboard.

4) Plug a resistor into the positive end of the breadboard to hole (3,A).

5) Plug a resistor into the (3,C) and into (6,C).

6) Plug a resistor into the (6,D) and into (9, D).

7) Plug the long end of the led (positive) to (9,E) and (12,E).

8) Plug a wire into (12,B) and the negative end of the breadboard.

## Review
 
- Volts are the amount of electrical force / pressure is running through the wire.
- Amps is the amount of electrons running the wire per second.
- Resistance is a measurement of how much a material does not allow electrons to travel through it.
- Ohms law is V = I x R.  It's used to calculate what resistor / battery you need to power a circuit.
- What is the relationship between volts, resistance, and amps.
