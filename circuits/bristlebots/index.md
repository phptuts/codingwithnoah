## Objective

To learn about dc motors and to build a cool brainless robot.

## Kit

## Completed Project

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x tooth brush ($1.00)
- 1 x lr44 watch battery ($.50)
- 1 x Micro Vibration Motor ($.80)
- 1 x pipe cleaners arts stuff ($.50)
- 1 x rubber band ($.04)
- 1 x art stuff ($.50) 
- total $3.34 ish

## Motor

A motor is an electrical component that takes electrical energy and turns it into physical/mechanical energy by spinning a rod.  The direction that the rod moves in is determined by how it is hooked into the battery.

## Learning about motors

Group into 3 or 4 people. (Optional)
 
1) Take a piece of cardboard poke it through the metal rod of the motor.

![Motor Step 1](/images/circuits/bristlebots/step_motor_poke_hole.jpg)
 
2) Have one person hold the motor.  Have another person take the battery.  Place one wire attached to the motor and place it on the positive side of the battery.  Take the other wire of the motor and place it on the negative side of the battery.  Notice the direction the motor is turning in.  Now switch the wires and notice it turns in the opposite direction.

Make sure everyone gets a chance to hold the battery and the motor.  

## Bristle Bot Instructions

Before beginning test that motor works by touching wires of the motor the battery like you did with the larger motor before.



1) Cut the head of the tooth brush off.

2) Attach small motor to back of the tooth brush with a rubber band.

3) Cut a small piece of double sided tape.

4) Attach small piece of double sided tape to tooth brush.

5) Peel the other side of the tape off and attach one of the motor's wires to it.

6) Attach one side of the battery to the tape.

7) Take the other wire and touch it to the other end of the battery to make sure the motor still turns on.

8) Decorate your bot.

9) Using a piece of tape attach the other wire of the motor to the battery.

10) Play around with your bristle bot.

## Bristlebots Race 

Group into 3 to 4 people and create a race track.  You will have 10 to 15 minutes to do this with cardboard, glue, and anything we can get from the art supplies.  After the take a minutes to play around with the tracks and change the position of your battery and motor.  See if you can make the bot go in a straight line.  We'll then take about 10 to 15 minutes to race the bots.  

## Review

- What are the limitations of the bristbots?
- How do you change the direction the motor is spinning when you hook into a battery?
- What did you learn?
