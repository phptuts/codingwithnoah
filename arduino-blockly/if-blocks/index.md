## Objective

To learn the concept of if block.

## "If" Block

The block works by see what is attached to it is true.  If it is true it will execute the blocks inside the "do" section.  When would you need to use an if block?

## "Compare" Block

This block will return a true or false value by comparing 2 variables or values together.  You can compare text variable using  "=", and "â‰ ".  You can compare number variables using any of the options.  You can only compare variables of the same type.  For example you can compare 2 text variables but you can not compare text variable to a number variable.

## If block game

The object of the game is to try to get the if block person to make a mistake.  If the "If" statement get's it right person playing the "If" block gets to choose who is the if block next.  Two students will be variables and one camper will be the compare block. 

## Challenge 

Create 2 variables that are numbers and compare them in such a way that it turns on the built in led, pin 13.

Hint the "If" block and the "Compare" block are in the logic menu.
