## Bill of Materials

- 1 x Arduino Uno
- 1 x USB Arduino Cable
- 1 x led light strip
- 4 x male to male jumper wires


## Steps

Follow the directions in [Arduino Setup Guide](/arduino-setup) if your computer has not been setup yet.  

1) Follow the directions [Arduino Blockly Start Guide](/arduino-blockly-start) to start the [Arduino Blockly Webpage](http://localhost:3000).
 
2) Open the [Arduino Blockly Webpage](http://localhost:3000).

3) Look at the bag it came the labels for the wires.  Notice the wires are labeled ground, volts, and data.

4) Take the led light strip out of the bag.  Notice the arrow and direction it is pointing.  You want to hook the wires at the start of the pointing arrow.
