## New Electrical Components 

![Breadboard](/images/summer-camp/day-1/breadboard/breadboard.jpg)

The breadboard is used to create / prototype electronic projects without gluing the wires together with metal.  We'll see how they are wired and used by creating one ourselves.

## Instructions

Group into groups of 4 to 5 people.  

1) Draw 2 horizontal lines at the bottom of the poser board.  The lines should be about 2 feet in length.

![step 1](/images/summer-camp/day-1/breadboard/step_1.jpg)

2) Draw a big dot every 6 inches on each of the lines.

![step 2](/images/summer-camp/day-1/breadboard/step_2.jpg)

3) Draw 3 vertical lines each about 1 foot a part and a foot in length.

4) Draw a dot on each line every 6 inches.

5) Use the wire strippers to cut 16 wires 7 inches long.  Strip 6 inches on each end of the wire.

6) Attach the wires one the lines you have draw. Do this to the bottom part of the poster board.  Then call a camp counselor to review your work.  Twist the wires together.  Also draw a + on top and a - on the bottom of the poster board.

7) Do the same thing you did in the previous step to the columns above.

8) Attach the battery to the bottom wires.  Do this by placing the (-) wire on the bottom and the (+) wire on the top.  Then tape it all down.  Before moving on have a counselor qa this step.

9) Attach a wire from the positive row to the first column.

![step 9](/images/summer-camp/day-1/breadboard/step_9.jpg)

10) Attach a wire from the negative row  to the second column.

![step 10](/images/summer-camp/day-1/breadboard/step_10.jpg)

11) Attach the positive end of the led to the first column and the negative end of the led to the second column.  The led positive end will be marked with a piece of tape.

Challenge 1) Can rewire the breadboard to use a resistor.

Challenge 2) Can you wire the circuit you just created to use an actual breadboard now that you know how it works.  

Hint to do challenge 2 you will have to remove the watch battery and cut new wire.

## Review

Talk about breadboards and what we learned about them.
