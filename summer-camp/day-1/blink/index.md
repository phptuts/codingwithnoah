## Objective

To learn about the delay block and how to blink an led outside of the Arduino.

## Project Kit

## Completed Project

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x Arduino with usb
- 1 x breadboard
- 2 x led
- 2 x resistors
- 4 x wires

##  Beginner Challenges 
 
Challenge 1) Based on what you have learned about the digital write block & breadboards build a circuit and make the led turn on.  Have an instructor approve your work.

Challenge 2) Can you make the led turn off.

Challenge 3) Can you hook another led up to pin 8 and turn both leds on.

## New Blocks

The delay block is used to pause the program for amount of time.  The amount of time the program pauses is determined by the number inside the delay block.  In the example about the program will pause for 1000 milliseconds or one second.

Challenge 3) Can you make the led attached to pin 7 blink every second.  

Hint write down the steps.

1) Turn on the led using the delay block
2) pause the program for one second

Challenge 4) Can you modify your code so that it will turn on led 7 and off 8, wait a second, then on led 8 and off led 7, then wait another second.

Hint write down the steps again.

Challenge 5) Can you change your code so that led attached to pin 7 stays on for 5 seconds and the led on pin 8 stays off for 5 seconds.  Then the led on 8 should go one for 1 second while the led on pin 7 is off.

Challenge 6) Have fun and make your own led light patterns.

## Review 

Have a conversation about what we learned. :)
