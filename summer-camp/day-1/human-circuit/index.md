## Objective

To learn about how electricity works with batteries, led, and resistors.

## Project Kit

## Completed Project

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x Watch Battery 3 volts ($5.00)
- Wires ($.50)
- 1 x Resistor under 1000 ohms ($.04)
- 1 x led ($.09)
- total $5.93 

## New Electrical Components 

### Led

The led stands for light emitting diode.  The important thing to note is the wires connected to it.  The long wire is the positive and the short wire is the negative.  When you pass electricity through it, it will emit light.

### Resistor

The resistor is used to decrease the amount of electrons flowing through the wire.  The strength of the resistor is determine by the colors of the bands.  You can use the [calculator](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/resistor-color-code-calculator/) to learn more.

### Battery

The battery is power source of a circuit.  All batteries have a positive side and a negative side.  Electricity will flow from the positive side to the negative side (ground).  The reason we diagram things out this way is because the standard was set in the 1800's and we would have to change everything in order to fix it.

## Instructions

1) Take the piece on your desk and touch it to the camper next to you.  If you have led hold it up so everyone can see it.

2) The instructor will touch the wire to the watch battery.  Notice that the light when the instructor touches the battery the wires to the battery.  

3) Now ask the camper's what will happen once a person disconnects their wire?  Let them have a mini debate.

4) Then have a person do this to see who was right.

5) Pass the battery around the circle and ask the camper's if they can tell you which side is positive and which side is negative.

6) The instructor takes back the battery and ask what will happen if the instructor switches the way the led is hooked up with the battery.  Have a mini debate.

7) Then do it and see what happens.

8) Explain that an led will only let electricity flow one way from the positive end to the negative end.  The way you can tell is that the positive end is the long end of the led.  Explain that a led is a light emitting diode.  A diode is an electronic component that only allow electricity to flow one way.  Explain the electricity flows from positive to ground.  Explain the reason is that we view it this way is because people in the 1800's got it wrong. :)

9) Now have the other instructor place a resistor into the circuit.  Explain that a resistor will decrease the amount of electrons flowing through the wire.  

10) Now ask the campers what will happen if the instructor switches the side the resistor is hooked up.  have a mini debate.

11) Now have the instructor do that.

12) Now review and ask the campers a bunch of questions to be sure that they understand the material.

13) Now have camper blink the led 1 second for 20 seconds.  Ask them if they did this consistently? Ask them if they can think of a better way of doing it consistently?
