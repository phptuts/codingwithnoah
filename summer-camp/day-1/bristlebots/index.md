## Project Kit

## What it looks like

## Bill of Materials 

### Bristlebots Assembly 


#### TODO  (Will fill out once mine get in.)

Have the motor with to both end of the motor.  Ask the camper to notice the difference between hooking the motor to the batter from positive to negative and negative to positive?

### Bristlebots Race 

The campers will have 10 minutes ot optimize their bristlebots for the race.  Encourage them to time different designs and record which one is faster.  After that have a tournament style race, with brackets.  First prize gets to choose the break activity.  Ask the campers what they learned about their design.  Have a quick review.

### Bristle battle bots 

Have campers group in pairs of 4 or 5.  Have them construct a circular battle bot arena with card board obstacles.  Give them a time limit of 10 minutes.  Then allow the campers to battle in each arena.  Let them have fun and play around.  After this let them play with the bristle bots how they want to.  

After this is done gather campers around ask them about the limitation of bristlebots and how they might design a better robot.  What would they need in order to do that?
