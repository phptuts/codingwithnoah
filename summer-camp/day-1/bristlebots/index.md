## Objective

To learn about dc motors and to build a cool robot without a brain.

## Bill of Materials 

- 1 x tooth brush ($1.00)
- 1 x lr44 watch battery ($.50)
- 1 x Micro Vibration Motor ($.80)
- 1 x pipe cleaners arts stuff ($.50)
- 1 x rubber band ($.04)
- 1 x art stuff ($.50) 
- total $3.34 ish

## New Electrical Components 

### Motor

A motor is an electrical component that takes electrical energy and turns it into physical/mechanical energy by spinning a rod.  The direction that the rod moves in is determined by how it is hooked into the battery.

#### Learning about motors

1) Group into 3 or 4 people. (Optional)
 
2) Take a piece of cardboard poke it through the metal rod of the motor.

3) One person hold the motor while another person take a wire from the motor and holds it to the positive side.  Take the other wire of the motor and hold it to the negative side.  You should notice the motor spin the cardboard in a direction.  Now switch wires on the battery and notice how it turns the cardboard in a different direction.

4) Make sure everyone gets a chance to hold the battery and the motor.  Also make wait for the counselors signal to move forward.  Please ask any question you have as well.

### Bristle Bot Instructions

Before beginning test that motor works by touching wires of the motor the battery like you did with the larger motor before.



1) Cut the head of the tooth brush off.

2) Attach small motor to back of the tooth brush with a rubber band.

3) Cut a small piece of double sided tape.

4) Attach small piece of double sided tape to tooth brush.

5) Pile the other side of the tape off and attach one of the motor's wires to it.

6) Attach one side of the battery to the motor to the tape.

7) Take the other wire and touch it to the other end of the battery to make sure the motor still turns on.

8) Decorate your bot.

9) Take a piece of take and attach the other wire to it.

10) Take 5 to 10 minutes and play around with your bristle bot.

### Bristlebots Race 

Group into 3 to 4 people and create a race track.  You will have 10 to 15 minutes to do this with cardboard, glue, and anything we can get from the art supplies.  After the take minutes to play around with the tracks and change the position of your battery and motor.  See if you can make the bot go in a straight line.  We'll then take about 10 to 15 minutes to race the bots.  

### Limitations of bristle bots

We'll then have a conversation on the limitations of the bristlebots and how we can improve on this model.
