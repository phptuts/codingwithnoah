## Why?
 
Have a conversation about why you would need an "If" block and what it's used for.  

## "If" Block

The block works by see what is attached to it is true.  If it is true it will execute the blocks inside the "do" section.

## "Compare" Block

This block will return a true or false value by comparing 2 variables or values together.  You can compare text variable using  "=", and "â‰ ".  You can compare number variables using any of the options.  You can only compare variables of the same type.  For example you can compare 2 text variables but you can not compare text variable to a number variable.

## If block game

The object of the game is to try to get the if person playing the if statement to error.  If the "If" statement get's it right person playing the "If" statement gets to choose who is the if statement next.  Two campers we'll be variables and one camper we'll be the compare block. 

## Challenge 

Create 2 variables that are numbers and compare them in such a way that it turns on the built in led, pin 13.

Hint the "If" block and the "Compare" block are in the logic menu.
