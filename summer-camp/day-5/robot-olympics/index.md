## Objective

To play with the robot and get better a programming.  Also to have fun. :)

## Race the Arduino

Tape up the floor with 2 straight lines about a foot a part.  The only rule is that the Arduino can not touch either tape line.  Whoever gets their the fastest wins. 

## Synchronized Robots

Team up in groups of 4 to 5 and come up with a dance routine for the robots.  We'll fine some fun music you have the robots dance to.

## Come up with your own competition

Instructors must approve the competition and it will be decided with a vote.
