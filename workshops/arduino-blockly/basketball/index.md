This is the arduino basketball workshop.  We are going to creating a basketball game that you can play.  By the end of this course the goal is that you can build your own games with the Arduinos.  

## Project

![completed project](/images/arduino-block/basketball-workshop/coding_steps/challenge.gif#img-phone)

## Objective

To learn how to use sensors, servos, lcd screens to build games with the Arduino.  You should also walk away with an understanding basic coding concepts that will enable you to build a game.
